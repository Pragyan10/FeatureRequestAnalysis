All the links posted by @Gargron are resolved.What Play Store & Apple Store did makes no sense & so does the reasons provided.If paedophiles watch child porn on chrome browser/safari in their mobiles (which they do), are Google/Apple going to remove these browsers from the store? Browser is just a client. It has no obligation to spy on users as to what content they are watching (if it spies, no one will use it even for legitimate purpose, let alone pedos).This client app is just a tool to connect to any mastodon server & load content. Since the app got no control over the servers (nor should it), there is no good reason to ban official Mastodon app, let alone other clients. Here are my reasons why they cant ban this app for meeting basic expectationsThese Big tech bullies must have assumed people wont complain if they bully app developers (which they know they can do, thanks to \"legal\" monopolies they have which they ensured thru bribes to politicians to not break these monopolies), but since mastodon is mainstream app, they cant bully that easily now.Incase of twitter, the data is stored on twitter servers. So, Apple & Google can bully. But incase of mastodon, the app has no business to know which instance its talking to & what content is being stored in it. So, this app cant be held liable to for any harmful content.If issue is the threat of banning (which imo is not a legitimate concern), why not publish multiple versions of app to playstore, where new development happens on a canary version (to test waters in playstore with all experimental features), while main app is still available for download incase if canary version is banned (unlikely)?& also publish same canary version to non-google repos too, but still certified by repo maintainers to be malware free, so people can still install it if BTB take it down & the issue is being litigated, people can still download feature rich app?

There are more advanced apps for more advanced users.Where is this position made clear? In comments of Github issues is not really useful. I just had a look at the Play Store listing. The listing says nothing about that.This is the Mastodon official Android application. It's reasonable to expect it to provide the full Mastodon experience. If it's purposefully not going to, make that clear in the Play Store listing. Make it clear in the README.md of this repository. Make it clear in the official blog post that readme links to.Maybe even name the application to reflect that. Mastodon Basic or something. As it stands, people are going to install this application expecting the full experience, and then be really confused as people in their timelines tell them to do things like make their replies Unlisted that the application does not and apparently will not support.Except the bookmarks feature is not currently planned and I don't know if or when it will be.
