## Notes for Annotation 

- If you want to make change: mark the text you want to remove from your annotation as "red" - mark the text you added to your existing annotation as "green" -- *** Only make changes for your row ***
- Annotation Notes:
  1. If there is some information missing to an annotation and is incomplete but not ambigious then add them as syntactic-eliptical
  2. Make notes for instances if you see same class but different sub class. Maybe draw reasons on why? What do you see. 
  3. If adding any new follow the dictionary format. Attributes inside the dictionary:
     1. text: highlighted text from the original request
     2. reason: why did you annnotate it 
     3. incompleteness: is the annotation incomplete? does adding something to the annotation make it not ambigious
     4. weight: impact of the ambigity for implementation/development/change to the current system
     5. start/end index: tool will handle this
  4. "Vagueness" added to the annotation columns
